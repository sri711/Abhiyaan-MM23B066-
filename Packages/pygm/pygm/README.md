# Autonomous-Car-Racing
1. race_car.py contains a racing game that you can play with you right and left keys on your keyboard. 

2. obstacles.py is a rospy script that randomly generates obstacles and publishes the coordinates of the obstacles to a rostopic called /obstacles
   
Your job is to create a script called autonomous.py that can play the game on its own with the help of the /obstacles rostopic.
