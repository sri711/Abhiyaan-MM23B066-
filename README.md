Why I want to be a part of Team Abhiyaan:

        I am passionately intrested in the fields of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence and am constantly looking to explore the fileds more deeply as these 
        fields have enormous potentials.The idea of autonomous technology i.e technology that can operate on its own without human intervention is something i am 
        veryy fascinated of since my childhood exposure to sci fi.AI/ML is a field that genuinely captivates me as it has the potential to match and also surpass 
        human levels of intelligence, I see this as the way humans can play god by creating their own version of autonomous robots and it really intrigues me.
        I really look forward to getting hands on experience in building such autonomous models .I thus find Abhiyaan to be the right fit as they allign very 
        deeply with my intrests and career aspirations. The new competition, robocup that Abhiyaan will be undertaking this year also is very intresting because of
        the project being related to the fields of swarm robotics and autonomous robots which adds to the countless reasons why Abhiyaan appeals the most to me.

Other Relevant Things:
      -I am intrested in all things related to computer science (hope to become a software whizz)
      -I find the abhiyaan t shirt to be very cool

All questions attempted have been put in corresponding folders
each of the questions have a process text file explaining the process of solving the question and the logic used in the code
another folder containing the screenshots of the relevant output will be there
a folder called the packages contains all the ros packages used throughout the application
this is done even tho the relevant python scripts have been added in the respective question's folders
If any further clarifications are needed, ill be happy to explain them in the interview  :)
