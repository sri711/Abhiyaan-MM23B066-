All questions attempted have been put in corresponding folders
each of the questions have a process text file explaining the process of solving the question and the logic used in the code
another folder containing the screenshots of the relevant output will be there
a folder called the packages contains all the ros packages used throughout the application
this is done even tho the relevant python scripts have been added in the respective question's folders
If any further clarifications are needed, ill be happy to explain them in the interview () :)
