Process
1)setting up shared folders with vbox
2)had to unzip given file foor being able to share
3)given folder in itself is a workspace, no need to mount it on a workspace again and buil it
4)shared file from windows to vbox
5)opened it using terminal and ran the commands given in the app
6)subscribing to the given topic

Learning
1)A workspace is a directory containing ROS 2 packages
 NODES
    -each node is responsible for a single, modular purpose
    -nodes can send and receive data from other nodes thro topics, services, actions, or parameters
    -A single exxectuable program file can have multiple nodes
    -"ros2 run" command runs the executable from a packaage
    -"ros2 node list" command will show you the names of all running nodes
    -remapping command
    -node info command
TOPICS
    -topics act as a bus for nodes to exchange messages
    -rqt_graph helps visualize all the nodes and the topics subscribed to
    - ros2 topic list command
    -ros2 topic echo command
    -ros2 topic info command
    -ros2 interface show command
    -ros2 topic pub command-publishes messages dierectly if given in proper format
    -publishing the command w the rate option gives out a steady stream of command instead of a one time message
    -ros2 topic hz command
SERVICES 
    -Services are another method of communication for NODES
    -based on a call-and-response model versus the publisher-subscriber model of topics
    -provides data only when specifically called upon
    -ros2 serivce type command
