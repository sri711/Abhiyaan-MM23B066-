El Psy Congroo - the mind is indeed expected to be congruous in swarm robotics :)

multi robot systems-A system consisted of multiple robots which can cooperate and communicate with each other to accomplish certain tasks

swarm robotics- it is basically the integration of swarm intelligence (decentralizeed, self organized) with robotics
(just like the villain's robots in big hero 6)
this includes various fields such as
    -drones
    -military applications
    -nanorobotics\ microbotics
    -micro air vehicles

STRATEGY:-
let us name our players A,B and C
at any point in the gaame we have 2 options
    -attack
    -defence
we can choose either one of this based on the opponent's position
for both the options wwe will allocate on of our players to be in our side of the pitch at all times (assuming C)
c will be the flying goalie (acting as the goalkeeper and the defender) at all times

OFFENCE
-to play offence, we must  have possession of the ball
-in offence, our main target is to score goals,
-so our first task should be to take possession of the ball first
-after that our strategy must be to move towards the goal avoiding the opponent;s defenders
-our options would be to dribble or pass
-when we the dribbler(B) is blocked by a defender we have 2 options shoot/pass
-for both cases A must make itself free by not being marked down by the defender in order to receive the pass or collect the rebound
 
DEFENCE 
-if the opponent has the ball we mark them and try to steal the ball while not letting them move forward and by marking them
-if either of the opponent bots are inside the penalty area, both our bots (A and B) must mark the opponent bot with the ball
-if not each bot must mark the nearest bot 
-after marking we must try and steal the ball 
-if we are succesfull, we will switch strategy to offence
