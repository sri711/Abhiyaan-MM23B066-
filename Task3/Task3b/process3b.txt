Process

1)import necessary modules
-user define functions for
    -Function for distance btw circles
    -Function to generate random circles in a mask
    -Function to check if distance between points is less than 40(we have defined the minimum closest distance to be 40)
    (and the circles to be of radius 10) this fn if dist is less than 40 returns false

2)defining initial and final points
-we define a mask of size 500x500 and draw 10 random circle in it such that the circles always have distance between them > 40
-next define bhai in the field raandomly with a raadius 20
-to find final points we ddefine a circle of radius 70 around bhai and mark 10 eqully spaced points on the circle
-create another mask,mask_final showing the final position of the fans around bhai
-next we find the shortest final ppoint for each initial point adn draw the respective line indicating the optimal path
-we have to keep in mind to keep the final point distinct for each initial point so we iteratively delete the closest point
-we create a nested list, sd consisting of the initial and corresponding final poiints
-we create a mask, masksecfin with the lines
-we create a giant_mask and aadd all the 3 masks till now to show the initial point, final point and path using bitwise or

3)now we define the intermediate points btw initial and final points
-we interpolate and find the points between initial and final points
-we define them= points to be equidistant from one another so that the speed of the robots are constant throughout
-we create a videofile showing the motion of the points using masks
-we print the sd list whiich has initial,final coords for the robots
-we also print interpol_history which basically has the coord for all the circle's intial,final and also interpolated points

WORKING ON:
-we have to modify the code such that for any intermediate position, the distance btw the robots must not be less than 40
-approach 
    -we calculate the dist btw circles using the data from the interpol_history nested list
    -if any dist<40 we must alter the coordinate such that it is euidistant from the previous coordinate 
    but also satisfies the min dist btw robots
    -we mustmake sure it is equidistantfrom the previous coord as we dont want to alter the speed of the robots
