PROCESS
-we create object_movement.py
-we imprt necessary packages
-we construct the argument using the parse function from the argparse library
-we add arguments for the video file and the buffer
-this buffer is a cap on the maximum size of the deque which is basically the history of the location of the point (x,y coordinates)
-the buffer is by default 32 frames
-we use the HSV (hue,saturation and value) coordinates of the colour to be identifies
-we define the upper and lower colour bound of


command line
python object_movement.py -v single_ball.mov

LEARNING
-we import deques from collections, Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues,
 it is used to efficiently store the points the object has been detected and tracked at
-HSV-Hue Saturation and value
