PROCESS

1)IMPORTING PACKAGES AND INITIALIZING VARIABLES
-we create object_movement.py
-we imprt necessary packages
-we construct the argument using the parse function from the argparse library
-we add arguments for the video file and the buffer
-this buffer is a cap on the maximum size of the deque which is basically the history of the location of the point (x,y coordinates)
-the buffer is by default 32 frames
-we use the HSV (hue,saturation and value) coordinates of the colour to be identified
-we define the upper and lower colour bound of the blue ball
-next we initialise pts to be a deque and initialise a few other variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)PROCESSING THE FRAMES OF THE VIDEO
-now we grab a pointer vs to the video file given
-this pointer now allows us to create a loop and process the whole video frame by frame 
-we get the frame by "frame = frame[1] if args.get("video", False) else frame" from the video file
-we discard frame[0] as it contains metadata
-we break the loop when we have processed the entire video file
-we resize the frame to a width of 600 pixels, standardising the size of the frame
-next we use gaussian blur to reduce noise and smoothen the image 
-the (11,11) indicates the kernel size for gaaussian blur
-and convert the frame to the HSV color space
-we now create a binary mask that identifies the colour of the ball using the inrange function
-we run a series of erosions and dilations to remove inconsistencies in the mask
-now we use the findcontours function to find the outline of objects in the binary mask
-proceeding only if atleast  one contour is identified
-cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL retrieves only the outermost contour
-we initialize centre to none as of now but will later give it the pos of centroid
-cnts will now have the list of identified contours
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)WORKING ON THE CONTOUR 
-for every contour identified,we draw a minmum enclosing circle and get the coordinates and raadius of the circle/centroid
-we also find the moment of the particle using the function and from it find the coordinates of the center
-we draw the circle and the centroid and append the position to the pts deque
-now we iterate over the pts deque (we have appended it to the left which is not usual)
-we also have a buffer of 32 frames so we caalculate the dx,dy and d2x,d2y all wrt current  frame i and a previos frame of index -10
-we use a frame counter to make sure we always have 10 frames before calculating
-also we dont calculate velocity dierectly as we dont have time but instead we use no of frames,the dx,dy is per 10 frames and 
d2x,d2y is wrt 5 frames
-we finally print these in the window
- we also draw the tracked points so as to create a tail like effect
-finally we close all windows if the key q is pressed 
- we have also attaatched an arrow which shows the velocity vector of the ball

python object_movement.py -v single_ball.mov
python object_movement.py -v multiple_balls.mov

APPROACH FOR MULTIPLE BALLS
-I wasnt able to properly solve the multiple balls video as i got lots of errors
my apprroach was
APPROACH 1
    -iterate through all contours found in the mask
    -compute the centroid for each contour and get the position i.e centre from the moment function
    -i tried to creeate a dictionary with contour as the key and the pts deque as the value so that we can calculate position,velocity
    and acceleration from the deque seperately for each contour
    - but the error was contour being a tuple could not be the key
APPROACH 2
    -we use the enumerator() on the list of contours
but in both the approaches lots of error and bugs were found

LEARNING
-we import deques from collections, Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues,
 it is used to efficiently store the points the object has been detected and tracked at
-HSV
Hue Saturation and value is used to deine the upper and lower bound for the volour
as HSV is used to separate image luminance from color information which cant be done in RGB values
GAUSSIAN BLURRING
-Gaussian blurring is a mathematical function that softens an image by smoothing out uneven pixel value
-basically convolving using a gaussian surface
- a kernel refers to a small matrix that is used to perform the blurring operation on an image. 
The kernel specifies the weights that determine how much influence each pixel in the neighborhood of a target pixel has
DILATION
-consists of convolving an image \(A\) with some kernel
-the kernel scans and computes the maximal pixel value 
EROSION 
- It computes a local minimum over the area of given kernel.i.e, minimal pixel value
