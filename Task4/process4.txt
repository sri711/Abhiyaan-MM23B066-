PROCESS
-we create object_movement.py
-we imprt necessary packages
-we construct the argument using the parse function from the argparse library
-we add arguments for the video file and the buffer
-this buffer is a cap on the maximum size of the deque which is basically the history of the location of the point (x,y coordinates)
-the buffer is by default 32 frames
-we use the HSV (hue,saturation and value) coordinates of the colour to be identifies
-we define the upper and lower colour bound of the blue ball
-next we initialise pts to be a deque and initialise a few other variables
-now we grab a pointer vs to the video file given
-this pointer now allows us to create a loop and process the whole video frame by frame 
-we get the frame by "frame = frame[1] if args.get("video", False) else frame" from the video file
-we discard frame[0] as it contains metadata
-we break the loop when we have processed the entire video file

command line
python object_movement.py -v single_ball.mov

LEARNING
-we import deques from collections, Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues,
 it is used to efficiently store the points the object has been detected and tracked at
-HSV-Hue Saturation and value is used to deine the upper and lower bound for the volour
as HSV is used to separate image luminance from color information which cant be done in RGB values
