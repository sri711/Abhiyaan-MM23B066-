PROCESS 
-We are using the ENet deep learning architecture
-imutils is a openCV package with series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as 
 translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, displaying Matplotlib images, sorting contours, detecting edges, 
 and much more easier with OpenCV
 
LEARNING
image segmentation is of 3types 
-Semantic segmentation
-Instance segmentation
-Panoptic segmentation
Semantic segmentation is a deep learning algorithm that associates a label or category with every pixel in an image
Instance segmentation is same as semantic but it also distinguishes between different objects of the same class
panoptic is a mix of both
to build a model we use convolutional neural networks
 The approach to build asemantic segmentation model is 
    -build a fully convolutional network which makes predictions for all the pixels 
    -to increase efficiency as we are working with a lot of pixels we introduce pooling layers (downsampling)
        -The basic goal of pooling is to maintain the most relevant information This may avoid overfitting and increase efficiency
        -types of poolings:
            -max pooling
            -average pooling
    -after processing we will need to unpool
        types of unpooling-
            -Bed of nails unpooling
            -Nearest neighbor unpooling
            -"Max" unpooling
    -we model the CNN using the cross entropy loss function
