PROCESS
-we download and unzip the given folder,
-we have created a dierectory and built a package called pygm
-in pygm we place the racecar.py and obstacle2.py files
-we also place the music and the images file ini the home file of the dierectory

now we need to change the racecar.py as it aldredy is generating the obstacles through the random function
we need to change it by making it a node and subscribing it to the /obstacle rostopic instead which generates the obstacles

-obstacleros3.py is basically a node that publishes whatever message the topic, /obstacle gives
-the publsih_obstacle method generates random values for the x coordinate 
-Constructs a message string containing the obstacle information in the format 'x,y,width,height' and publishes it into the topic

now, racecar.py
-in the given code, we modify such that
    - a new node (pygame_node) is created and it subscribes to the topic, /obstacles
    - we draw the obstacle after gtting the coordinates i.e the string
    -finally we delete the key control and instead bring in the autonomous driving system
    -we do this by calculating which side the obstacle is being published in and moving the vehicle to the opposite side if it aldready isnt
